# EmployeeManagement-SpringBootCrud-Postman-MySQL
  Spring Boot application, you can manage employee data using a database along with the Spring Data JPA framework. I'll provide you with an overview of how to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for employee management in Spring Boot.

1. Setting Up the Spring Boot Project:

To get started, you need to set up a Spring Boot project. You can do this using Spring Initializer or your preferred method. Make sure to include the necessary dependencies, including Spring Data JPA, Spring Web, and a database driver (e.g., H2, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).

2. Create an Employee Entity:

Create an Employee entity class that represents the employee data. Annotate it with @Entity to indicate it's a JPA entity, and use annotations like @Id, @GeneratedValue, and @Column to define the primary key and columns.

3. Create a Repository Interface:

Create a repository interface for Employee using Spring Data JPA. Spring Data JPA provides repository CRUD methods out of the box.

Model (Employee Entity): Represents the structure of employee data using Java classes, annotated with JPA annotations.

Repository (EmployeeRepository): Provides CRUD operations for the Employee entity, typically extending JpaRepository provided by Spring Data JPA.

Controller (EmployeeController): Handles HTTP requests and defines endpoints for CRUD operations, acting as an interface between the client and the application.
